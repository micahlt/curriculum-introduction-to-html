# Introduction to HTML
## 1.0 - What is HTML?
HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language is a _markup language_, which means that it simply has the ability to define _elements_ within a document.  While HTML has many applications, it is most known for being the primary markup language of the Internet, a vast collection of interlinked documents written not only with HTML but also PHP, XML, and the like.  

There are several core components that define HTML.
- **Tags**: tags make up the structure of HTML.  They are made up of the less than (`<`) and greater than (`>`) symbols, and often forward slashes (`/`).  
- **Opening Tags**: opening tags begin a section of an HTML document.  The first opening tag you'll learn to use is `<html>`, which defines the start of an HTML document.  
- **Closing Tags**: closing tags end a section of an HTML document.  Not every element has a closing tags, but about 90 percent do.  

## 1.1 - Where to Write HTML
HTML is fairly easy to get started with, as you don't need any complicated or pricey programs to write it.  Many people begin writing HTML in a default program installed on their computer, such as Windows Notepad.  You can use the Ideoxan Web IDE.
